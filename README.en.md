## Project Scope

This project adapts the Qoder CLI (`qoderclicn` or `qodercli`) into a local-only OpenAI / Anthropic-compatible HTTP interface for studying protocol differences across local clients, message formats, streaming responses, and tool call schemas.

Two backends are supported:

- **CN backend**: `qoderclicn`, connecting to qoder.com.cn
- **Global backend**: `qodercli`, connecting to qoder.com

It is not an official API, does not imply official authorization, and does not provide account, Token, or quota services. All model calls depend on the user's own Qoder authentication.

## How It Works

`qoderclicn` and `qodercli` are command-line tools that accept text input and return text output. Many local clients and developer tools expect an OpenAI or Anthropic-format HTTP API. This project acts as a local adapter: it receives compatible API requests, translates them into CLI invocations, and converts CLI output back into compatible responses.

Supported local protocol formats:

- **OpenAI-compatible format**: `/v1/chat/completions`
- **Anthropic-compatible format**: `/v1/messages`

Both formats include tool-call field adaptation (`tool_calls` / `tool_use`) for compatibility research. Reliability depends on whether the underlying model consistently emits valid JSON.

## Tool Call Implementation

Because the CLI only handles text and has no native tool-calling channel, this project implements tool-call adaptation through prompt format instructions and output parsing: tool definitions are added as formatting guidance, then JSON tool calls are extracted from model text output.

This is different from calling official OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, or similar APIs. Official APIs usually provide a native `tools` parameter channel. This project only simulates protocol behavior at the text layer and should not be treated as an equivalent replacement.

## Security Boundaries

- Binds to `127.0.0.1` only, with no option to bind elsewhere
- **Cross-origin browser requests are refused** (loopback origins only). Otherwise
  any web page you visit could call the proxy in the background and spend your
  Qoder quota
- **Requests naming a non-loopback `Host` are refused**, which blocks DNS rebinding
- With `PROXY_API_KEY` set, `/v1/*` and `/usage/*` require the key
- Not intended or supported for public services, shared services, or commercial APIs
- Logs redact tokens, cookies, Authorization headers, and other sensitive data
- `.env`, tokens, and logs are excluded from version control

Worth stating plainly: **without `PROXY_API_KEY`, any process on your machine can
use the proxy.** Loopback binding keeps out the network, not your own machine.
Setting a key is recommended.

### Client Authentication (PROXY_API_KEY)

Once set in `.env`, clients must send the key as:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <PROXY_API_KEY>
```

or, as Anthropic-style clients prefer:

```text
x-api-key: <PROXY_API_KEY>
```

Leave it empty to require no key. `/health` is always open so scripts can probe
liveness.

If a local web app legitimately needs browser access, allow it explicitly with
`ALLOWED_ORIGINS`; if you deliberately reach the proxy under another hostname,
use `ALLOWED_HOSTS`. Both default to empty — once you use them, reviewing the
security model becomes your job.

### Upstream Authentication

| Backend | Auth Method | Environment Variable |
|---------|------------|--------------------|
| CN (`qoderclicn`) | Personal Access Token | `QODERCN_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` |
| Global (`qodercli`) | OAuth login (`qodercli login`) | Not required |

### Server-Side Tool Execution (off by default)

`SERVER_TOOL_EXECUTION=1` makes the proxy run the model's tool calls **on your
machine**, and the model is steered by whatever prompt the client sent. Keep it
off unless your client genuinely cannot execute tools itself. When enabled:

- File operations are confined to `SERVER_TOOL_WORKSPACE` (default: the proxy's
  working directory). Absolute paths and symlinks leaving it are refused
- The `Bash` tool additionally requires `SERVER_TOOL_ALLOW_BASH=1` **and** a
  non-empty `SERVER_TOOL_BASH_ALLOWLIST`. Commands run without a shell, so
  chaining, pipes, redirection, and substitution are refused
- On Windows, skipping the shell means `.cmd`/`.bat` shims (such as `npm`) cannot
  run — only real executables (`node`, `git`, `python`)

Treat the feature as experimental, and pair it with `PROXY_API_KEY`.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details.

## Abuse Policy

- No public deployment
- No multi-user sharing
- No API resale
- No bypassing official billing, risk controls, rate limits, regional restrictions, or usage restrictions
- No collecting, storing, or forwarding other people's Tokens
- No providing, sharing, renting, reselling, or transferring accounts, Tokens, or quota

## Safety Recommendations

- Use only on your own machine
- Bind only to `127.0.0.1`
- Do not bind to `0.0.0.0` and do not expose the service to the public internet
- Do not send your Token to anyone
- Do not commit `.env` to Git
- If you suspect a Token leak, revoke the PAT immediately from the official Qoder account page and create a new one

## Setup

Requires Node.js 18+.

**CN backend** (required):

```bash
npm install -g @qodercn-ai/qoderclicn
qoderclicn --version
```

**Global backend** (optional):

```bash
npm install -g @qoder-ai/qodercli
qodercli --version
qodercli login   # must log in once
```

Install dependencies and create configuration:

```powershell
npm install
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and configure the backend and authentication:

```env
# Choose backend: "cn" or "global"
CLI_BACKEND=cn

# CN backend: your Personal Access Token
QODERCN_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-cn-token

# Global backend: no token needed after running qodercli login
```

CN PAT page: https://qoder.com.cn/account/integrations

Store it securely. Do not commit `.env` to Git, and do not enter your Token into third-party clients or share it with others.

Start:

```powershell
npm start
```

You can also compile to a single file with esbuild and run the bundle (output at `dist/server.js`):

```powershell
npm run build        # compile
npm run start:prod   # run the compiled bundle
npm run build:start  # compile and start in one step
```

On Windows, you can also double-click `start-proxy.cmd`.

Default local address:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

If you manually change host behavior through environment variables or code edits, keep it bound to `127.0.0.1`. Do not bind to `0.0.0.0`, and do not expose it through port forwarding, reverse proxies, tunnels, or cloud servers.

## Supported Models

`auto`, `qwen3.8-max`, `qwen3.7-max`, `qwen3.7-plus`, `qwen3.6-flash`, `deepseek-v4-pro`, `deepseek-v4-flash`, `glm-5.2`, `kimi-k2.7-code`, `minimax-m2.7`

Legacy `-effort-*` suffixed model IDs are still accepted and resolve to the base model plus a reasoning effort parameter.

## Local Client Adaptation

### OpenAI-Compatible Interface

For local clients that support custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints:

- Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1`
- API Key: the `PROXY_API_KEY` you set in `.env`; if you did not set one, any
  placeholder works (for example `not-used`)
- Model: select from `/v1/models` or enter a model ID manually

Do not enter your Qoder Token into the client. Keep the Token only in this project's local `.env`.

## Dual Backend Switching

Switch backends via `CLI_BACKEND` in `.env`:

```env
CLI_BACKEND=cn       # use qoderclicn
CLI_BACKEND=global   # use qodercli
```

| Setting | CN Backend | Global Backend |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| CLI command | `qoderclicn` | `qodercli` |
| Auth method | Personal Access Token | `qodercli login` (OAuth) |
| Auth directory | `~/.qoderworkcn` | `~/.qoder` |
| Environment variable | `QODERCN_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Not required (auto-auth after login) |

Restart the proxy after switching backends.

### Anthropic-Compatible Interface

For local clients that support custom Anthropic-compatible endpoints:

```powershell
$env:ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:3000"
$env:ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN = "your-PROXY_API_KEY"   # any value if PROXY_API_KEY is unset
```

Do not append `/v1` to `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`; clients usually add API paths automatically.

### OpenCode Example

The repository includes `opencode.json` for local compatibility verification:

```powershell
opencode run --model qoder-cn-local/qwen3.7-max --variant high "reply OK"
```

If you set `PROXY_API_KEY`, replace `not-used` in `opencode.json`'s
`options.apiKey` with your key.

## API Endpoints

With `PROXY_API_KEY` set, `/v1/*` and `/usage/*` require the key; `/health` does not.

| Method | Path | Key required | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/health` | No | Health check |
| GET | `/v1/models` | Yes | Model list |
| POST | `/v1/chat/completions` | Yes | OpenAI-compatible chat with tools field adaptation |
| POST | `/v1/messages` | Yes | Anthropic-compatible chat with tool_use field adaptation |
| POST | `/v1/messages/count_tokens` | Yes | Token estimation |
| GET | `/usage/local` | Yes | Local usage estimate |
| POST | `/usage/reset-local` | Yes | Reset local usage statistics |

## Reasoning Options

Set global defaults via environment variables:

```powershell
$env:QODERCN_REASONING_EFFORT = "high"
$env:QODERCN_CONTEXT_WINDOW = "200000"
$env:QODERCN_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS = "4096"
```

Or specify per request via `reasoning_effort`, `context_window`, and `max_tokens`.

## Streaming

When a client requests `stream: true` without tools, this project uses the CLI's `--output-format stream-json` for incremental streaming and forwards text as local SSE events.

When a request includes tool parameters, streaming is downgraded to a non-streaming response because tool-call parsing requires complete JSON output.

## Current Limitations

- Tool calls are implemented through prompt format instructions and text parsing, not native model capability
- Tool-call responses are always non-streaming complete JSON responses
- Each request spawns a new CLI subprocess
- If the model emits invalid JSON or refuses the tool format, the response falls back to plain text

## Quick Verification

```powershell
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:3000/health
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/models
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/chat/completions `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d "{\"model\":\"qoder-cn\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"reply OK\"}]}"
```

## Testing
